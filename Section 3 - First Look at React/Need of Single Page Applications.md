# Client Side Rendering
- Client-side rendering (CSR) is a JavaScript technique that renders a website or application in a browser, rather than on a server. In CSR, the server sends a basic HTML file with links to JavaScript files, which the browser then downloads to render the page. 
- Here's how CSR works: 
   The server sends a basic HTML file to the browser 
   The browser downloads the JavaScript files 
   The JavaScript code fetches data from the server 
   The JavaScript code renders the user interface (UI) on the browser
