# State in React: 
-  State is the data that component hold over time, necessary for information that it needs to remember through app life cycle.
-  Eg: Notification count, message count, data that needs to be displayed in page.
- If we update the state of the component, then component gets re-rendered. 


Note: Don't set component's state value manually because it won't trigger component rendering.
